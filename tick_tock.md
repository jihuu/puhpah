Can we please already fast-forward to the point in time where the venerable Mr. Putin tries to launch the nukes (which, unbeknownst to him, and like so many other parts of the venerable Mr. Putin, are not in functioning condition), and some low-pay-grade bean counter musses his remaining hair, or some stewardess, with a family and a dream of a future that involves existence, puts an extra lump of sugar in his tea.
Because we all know that's exactly what is coming.

## TICK... TOCK...

We all know that's exactly what is coming, because it has already come. It has come time and time again.

We know that only after the venerable Mr. Putin joins the Farm Upstate, and only after his three-ring circus scrambles for the floorboards, only then can we start mourning; only then can we start burying the dead; only then can we start rebuilding; only then can we reach out to embrace our Russian brethren and sistren, and only then are we allowed to speak plainly to them of their future as fellow human beings who deserve inclusive normalcy instead of decades and centuries of grandiose, vile, and psychopathically-motivated regimes with dim-witted plots straight out of bad cold-war comic books.

We know that only after the venerable Mr. Putin joins the Farm Upstate, and only after his three-ring circus scrambles for the floorboards, only then can we swear "never again", once again. Only then, and even then only for the shortest of whiles, can we understand those words again. Only then, and even then only for the shortest of whiles, can we behave in accordance to those words again. Only then, and even then only for the shortest of whiles - but even the shortest of whiles will still be quantitatively and qualitatively superior to Nothing. And Nothing is exactly the kind of all-compassing everything that the immoral, inhumane nihilists of the venerable Mr. Putin's kind are offering to the mankind.

## TICK... TOCK...

We all know that's exactly what is coming, because it has already come. It has come time and time again.

The inhumane nihilist has tried to bring us his offering of Nothing many times in our past, and we have always rejected it. The offering of the inhumane nihilist will always be rejected by the mankind, because nihilism and Nothingness is not the essence of human being.
However, the inhumane nihilist will rise again, time and time again. Like a clockwork soldier, the inhumane nihilist will perform his movements of Nothing-offering, only to be rejected time and time again. This is because the inhumane nihilist can never understand the essence of human being. The inhumane nihilist thinks that by misleading us he can mislead his fate, and that by exsanguinating us he can exsanguinate the essence of human being.

In the end, the inhumane nihilist deserves our pity, because he did not choose to break his humanity. He had it broken for him from the beginning, and his malfunctioning humanity makes him offer us Nothing, time and time again.

Before the end, however, we know exactly what's coming.

## TICK... TOCK...

If fast-forwarding UTC is not yet possible, even with the most advanced Russian or Chinese military technology, we will have hard times ahead.

We will have hard times ahead, because it will be quite boring and cringey to watch the cancerous, calcified talking heads preach Russian Zupremacy on all frequencies they are still allowed to saturate and contaminate.

We will have hard times ahead, because it will be very difficult to try and pretend that anything the Russian psychopaths and their crony enablers say is surprising, or that anything they do is unforeseeable and most unexpected.

We will have hard times ahead, because it will be gloriously difficult, even for the most corrupt men and women, to keep saying that frankly, everything Russia does projects a very stable genius of the highest order of magnitude.

We will have hard times ahead, because we know for a fact, we've seen it by our own eyes, that the Russian regime is engaged in sick kayfabe, which has so far resulted in tens of thousands of dead civilians, tens of thousands of dead Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, and millions of displaced people and broken families.

## TICK... TOCK...

Alas, these tens of thousands of raped, burned, maimed, and robbed bodies are not enough. The millions of displaced human beings are not enough. The millions of victims are not enough.

The millions of victims are not enough for the venerable Mr. Putin, because his complexion requires a constant supply of innocent blood to stay ruddy

The millions of victims are not enough for the venerable Mr. Putin, because it is only by the virtue of the mystical, alchemical properties of violently-harvested collagen that the venerable Mr. Putin's comb-over, and the head it clings to, stays on, and does not start rolling around the cold, cold corridors of the Kremlin.

But the worst thing is that the millions of victims are not enough for us Europeans.

The millions of victims are not enough to make us say "stop", and they are not enough for us to tell our politicians to say "stop".

## TICK... TOCK...

Some of our politicians are reluctant. It's  understandable.

Some of them have been ever so well-greased, ever so well-oiled, ever so well-lubed, over the past decades by the sweet, unctuous Russian fossil products and the oil and gas they've been selling.

We have built an economy the size of a continent, but alas! We have built it on clay feet, clay feet molded by an inhumane empire. The price of the feet was right, some politicians will say, and they are not wrong. The price of our immaculate clay feet was right there for everyone with eyes to see. And we saw it, and we found it right, and we happily paid. Such good feet, so much clay!

And now we must stop paying.

## TICK...

Are we willing to do it?

## TOCK.

Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol. The dead. The maimed. The orphaned. The displaced. The absorbed. The denazified. The widowed, the raped, the filtered, the molten.

## TICK...

Is the price still right?

## TOCK.

Do we find it in ourselves to rise to the challenge of the Now? Do we find in our souls some small smidgen of nigh-untarnished humanity, a bit of compassion perhaps, a touch of Pleroma?

## TICK...

I guess some hard decisions need a-makin'.
